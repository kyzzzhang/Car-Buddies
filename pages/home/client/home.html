			<h1>Get a more convenient, comfortable and environmental friendly lifestyle!! </h1>
			<p class="sansserif"> The Car Buddies app aims to provide more convenient and personalized transportation for you. Nowadays, many people prefer to not have their own vehicle,
				and choose public transportation as a cheaper and more environmental friendly way. However, public transportation cannot reach directly to your every destination. Other transportation ways like Uber can have directly reach
				but quite expensive. To lower the cost by sharing the Uber with strangers who may not have the nearby destination as you can be time-consuming. By selecting the one who you want to share your car with or taking a uber together,
			based on their personal file, route and destination, your trip can not only be safer, faster and cheaper but also have much more fun. </p>
